<h1>Dynamic VLAN using RADIUS MAC Authentication</h1>
<em>Keywords: Ubiquiti, UniFi, EdgeOS, RADIUS, Dynamic VLAN assignment</em>
<article>
<p>
  I wanted to segment the clients on my wireless network. The correct way to do
  this is to use WPA2-Enterprise with 802.1X, but this will not work on all
  home devices such as my SmartTV. A workaround for this is to use multiple
  SSIDs with one VLAN per network and then connect each device to the
  corresponding network.  Another, much cooler way is to use RADIUS MAC
  authentication. This is supported on the UniFi platform but I haven't found
  any good instruction for how to set it up so here we go:
</p>

<p>
  When RADIUS MAC authentication is enabled, your access point will reach out
  to a RADIUS server and check if the device is allowed to connect and which
  VLAN it should use. The AP will use the connecting device's MAC-address as
  username and password for the request. It's very easy to spoof MAC-addresses
  so this type of authentication is pretty weak. Hopefully, my SmartTV will not
  be able to figure this out.
</p>

<p>
  There are some prerequisites if you want all this to work:
  <ul>
    <li>The access point must be connected to all VLANs that will be used.</li>
    <li>The access point's management interface cannot be one of the dynamically assigned VLANs.</li>
  </ul>
  For example, in my setup I've put the access points on VLAN 5, my TV on VLAN
  20 and all other clients on VLAN 10.

  The first thing you need is a RADIUS server. You can use FreeRADIUS but I
  felt it was too complicated. I also wanted a default VLAN for all
  other devices which was tricky to do. To solve this I've made a tiny RADIUS
  server that only support MAC authentication:
  <a href="https://github.com/carlanton/radius-mac/"><code>radius-mac</code></a>.
  The software must run on a server that can be accessed by your access point,
  preferably on the same LAN. I run it on my EdgeRouter X, but anything should
  work.
</p>

<p>
  <code>radius-mac</code> always accepts clients. If the client is not defined in the configuration, it will
  use the "default VLAN" instead. The configuration looks like this:
</p> 
<pre><code class="toml">[server]
address = 192.168.5.1
port = 1812
secret = shared-secret-xyz

; Clients that are not defined below will be assigned to a default VLAN:
default_vlan = 10

;
; Clients:
;

[10:11:12:13:14]
description = SmartTV
vlan = 22

[10:11:12:13:44]
description = Chromecast
vlan = 23

[20:81:12:13:44]
description = Toaster
vlan = 24
</code></pre>
<p>
  Then start the server: <code>radius-mac -c ./radius-mac.ini</code>
</p>
<p>
  If you want you can now test the server configuration using <code>radclient</code>:

<pre><code class="bash">$ (mac="20:81:12:13:44"; echo "User-Name=$mac, User-Password=$mac") | \
    radclient -x 192.168.5.1:1812 auth shared-secret-xyz

Sent Access-Request Id 239 from 192.168.5.2:35124 to 192.168.5.1:1812 length 54
    User-Name = "20:81:12:13:44"
    User-Password = "20:81:12:13:44"
    Cleartext-Password = "20:81:12:13:44"
Received Access-Accept Id 239 from 192.168.5.1:1812 to 192.168.5.2:35124 length 37
    Tunnel-Type:0 = VLAN
    Tunnel-Medium-Type:0 = IEEE-802
    Tunnel-Private-Group-Id:0 = "24" # this is the vlan-id!
</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>UniFi configuration</h2>
<p>
The next step is to create a RADIUS profile for your <code>radius-mac</code> instance. This
  is done in the UniFi controller under <code>Settings / Profiles / Create New Radius Profile</code>.
  Use the same IP address, port and shared secret as in the <code>radius-mac</code> configuration file.

<p>
  You also need to activate RADIUS MAC authentication for the wireless network.
  It's probably good to create a new wireless network when testing to avoid
  locking yourself out :)
